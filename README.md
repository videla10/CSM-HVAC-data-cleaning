# Colorado School of Mines HVAC data cleaning project
Project working with Dr. Fierro to clean data from Colorado School of Mines HVAC point label data. I am not allowed to share the data we are working with but for context I was given a parquet file to clean and tokenize in order to be used with a tool developed by the National Renewable energy lab.

In this repository is the code I used to take the parquet file and tokenize the point labels and output a JSON file.
